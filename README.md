#Dance Scheduler

This project gathers all of the relevant information for a few dance studios from around the city to compile all of their class offerings into one personal calendar.


##Work in Progress
This project began during my time at Recurse Center, but still has many pieces left to finish. Check back for more soon!

##Requirements
Included in this repository is a requirements.txt file which contains a list of all of the project requirements and their respective versions. In order to recreate the project environment, run 

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
